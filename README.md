# DVC
Digital Volume Correlation GUI Based on Matlab2019b.
It is free to use for personal or reaserch.

This GUI can calucute 800^3 voxel by XIAOMI Book (i5 8250U, 8G). If your data bigger, you could cut data and Hardly affects calculation accuracy.
After install FastDVC, please send your Host name of PC and cpuID, then you will sended a password.

The cited articals:
1. Accurate and simple digital volume correlation using pre-interpolation, Measurement Science and Technology, https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6501/ab85b0.
2. Dynamic three-dimensional imaging and digital volume correlation analysis to quantify shear bands in grus, Mechanics of Materials, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmat.2020.103646.

There most have a free key.mat (license) to open the iDVC.


The iDVC-try.exe do not need license, but can not save any results and only to try the pre analysis.
